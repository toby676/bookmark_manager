Bookmark Manager
------

This week's project is a bookmark manager. The goal is to expose you to the following aspects of web development:

Relational databases
Security considerations
More feature testing with Capybara
In addition to the technologies mentioned above, this project is going to be more challenging on the front-end. You shouldn't need more than we've covered in the previous weeks but you should expect to spend more time on the front-end, compared to last week. Of course, we'll also continue to be using the technologies we're familiar with: Sinatra, RSpec, etc.

We are going to build a bookmark manager, similar to pineapple.io or delicious.com in spirit. A bookmark manager is a good use case for exploring how relational databases work.

A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of links, organised by tags. You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse links other users have added.
